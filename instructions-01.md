## Task

Convert the HTML webpage `index.html` in the project root directory into a modern, fully functional Full Site Editing (FSE), Gutenberg-ready WordPress theme. All theme files are to be saved in a subdirectory called "corporate-theme-v3" which is to be created. Do not alter the reference file `index.html` in the project root directory.

## Theme Requirements

- Compatible with WordPress version 6.4 or newer.
- Utilize WordPress Full Site Editing (FSE) and block-based templates.
- Fully compatible with Gutenberg block editor.

## Functionalities to Preserve

- **CSS:** Fully integrate existing CSS without modifications.
- **JavaScript:** Retain and integrate all functionalities, specifically:

  - Hamburger mobile menu (with sliding transitions and submenus).
  - Persistent Dark/Light mode toggle.
  - Sticky header navigation.
  - Responsive mobile-first design.
  - Clickable WhatsApp icon with interactive behavior.

## Theme Structure & Block Patterns

Convert each significant HTML section into distinct FSE template parts and custom Gutenberg block patterns:

- Header
- Footer
- Hero Section
- Generic Content Sections
- Mobile Menu and Overlay
- Clickable WhatsApp Icon

## Design Consistency

- Exactly replicate the existing HTML pageâ€™s visual appearance, specifically:

  - Precise placement and positioning of header elements, navigation menus, and icons (including the dark/light theme toggle button).
  - Color schemes
  - Typography
  - Spacing
  - Responsive behaviors

- Preserve the exact HTML structure to ensure functionality and styling fidelity.

## Accessibility and SEO

- Retain accessibility features such as ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation (e.g., closing menus with ESC key).

## Asset Management

- Properly enqueue CSS and JavaScript using WordPress best practices.
- Dynamically reference theme assets instead of external image links.
