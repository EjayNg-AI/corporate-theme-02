Use patterns via Gutenberg block inserter under "Corporate Theme". Edit header and footer via site editor. Assets are enqueued in `functions.php`, and the CSS and JavaScript mirror the original `index.html` functionality.
All images, including the logo and WhatsApp icon, are loaded from external URLs. No image files are bundled with the theme.
